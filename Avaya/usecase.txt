=====
Note:
=====
LLM is not being used for this application as input is very strucuted. 
LLM is useful in case of free query processing  (like "book a flight or train ticket for Mumbai in next week. Check weather, calendar for suitable date" ).
In this case, LLM can be used to extrat entiry (source,destination,date ), generte structured query, assign task to avilable tools to take action.

Only change require for LLM is 
1. adding layer in server to call LLM which process query and generate structured query. 
2. instead of calling tool directly, LLM will decide which tool to use based on query.
